# X-tree

The present project indexes 170653 spotify songs within an X-tree and allows querying the k-nearest neighbors for a given point. The original file can be found in the following [website](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks). For this project, some modifications were made to the csv file for its correct reading and insertion into the tree, the modified file `spotify_dataset_cut.csv` can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VmkI-7iu7XPfoQFpg2IYUA5UPH8JKy6f/view?usp=sharing).

The  dataset columns are in the following order: *valence, acousticness, danceability, duration_ms, energy, explicit, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, popularity, speechiness, tempo, year, name, artists*. The first 14 attributes (dimensions) are numeric, therefore, considered for indexing, the last 3 attributes are used for song identification. To read the file, the separating commas must be replaced by spaces. This can be easily done by typing in the command line:
```
$ cat spotify_dataset_cut.csv | tr "," " " > spotify_dataset.csv
```
Once this repository is cloned, the resulting `spotify_dataset.csv` file have to be placed in the root inside the folder. Now, everything is ready to run the project. To do this, the following must be written on the command line:
```
$ cmake -B build
$ cd build
$ make
$ ./x-tree
```

### Executable Structure

First, the points are normalized and inserted within the X-tree, this operation takes approximately 70 seconds. Once the points are uploaded, one can perform the k-NN queries. Each query has 2 parameters, *k* and the point coordinates (14 floating numbers). The description of each dimension can be found in the [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks).

The result shows 4 important things: the number of registers visited during the query execution, the data of the *k* most similar songs, the query execution time, and the distance to the query point (and point itself) of the *k* results.

It is important to highlight that queries over sparse spaces (songs with particular attributes) are much faster because they visit fewer points to get the results.
